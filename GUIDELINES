Write for ANSI C (C89/C90).

Fully use the standard libraries, only building upon them where deemed necessary.

A valid reason to reinvent the wheel is because you don't need the overhead code of standard
libraries.

Don't write lines over 100 characters, unless deemed absolutely necessary.

/* Always use C style comments. */

If using GCC, any tests or examples should be compiled using -ansi, -Wall, -Wpedantic and -Werror.
