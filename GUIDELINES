Language:
- Write from ANSI C (C89/C90)
- Fully use the standard library, only building upon them where deemed necessary
- A valid reason to reinvent the wheel is because you don't need the overhead of standard libraries
- Don't write lines over 100 characters, unless deemed absolutely necessary
- /* Always use C-style comments. */

Compiler:
- If using GCC, any tests or examples should be compiled using -ansi, -Wall, -Wpedantic and -Werror

Code:
- Types are snake_case
- Functions, preprocessor functions and variables are camelCase
- Preprocessor variables are CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE
- Files are non-capitalized and without any spacing
