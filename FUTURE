If adding features relating to C99, or switching to C99, it is important to note the following:
- C99 introduced the "long long" types for signed and unsigned integers
- C99 also introduced int8 types, for byte datatypes
- GCC compilation would be done using the -std=c99 flag instead of -ansi
- Variadic macros would be useful for pDebugPrintf (preprocessor implementation)

Consider preprocessor functions being capital snake case.

Consider using vprintf for debug printing.
